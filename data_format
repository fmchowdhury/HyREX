For each sentence, HyREX expects input in the following format:

Abstract Id: DOCUMENT_ID_FOR_THE_SENTENCE
Sentence Id: SENTENCE_ID
THE_SENTENCE
__EMPTY_LINE__
ENTITY_ID_1 START_INDEX END_INDEX
ENTITY_TYPE
ENTITY_NAME
ENTITY_ID_2 START_INDEX END_INDEX
ENTITY_TYPE
ENTITY_NAME
__EMPTY_LINE__
RELATION_TYPE_OF_REL_1 ENTITY_ID_1 ENTITY_ID_2 POLARITY
RELATION_TYPE_OF_REL_2 ENTITY_ID_3 ENTITY_ID_4 POLARITY  
__EMPTY_LINE__


POLARITY means true or false. It is opotional. If polarity is not given than the it is considered as "true" by default and all the other possible pairs would be considered as negative (i.e. "false") relation instances. So, in that case it would be not required to provide "false" relations explicitely. However, if POLARITY is given, then both the "true" and "false" relations (that the system is expected to consider for training/testing) are required to be written explicitly.

If there is no entity or relation instance for the corresponding sentence, an extra blank line must be added. For example, if there is nor relation instance then the above sentence example would become -

Abstract Id: DOCUMENT_ID_FOR_THE_SENTENCE
Sentence Id: SENTENCE_ID
THE_SENTENCE
__EMPTY_LINE__
ENTITY_ID_1 START_INDEX END_INDEX
ENTITY_TYPE
ENTITY_NAME
ENTITY_ID_2 START_INDEX END_INDEX
ENTITY_TYPE
ENTITY_NAME
__EMPTY_LINE__
__EMPTY_LINE__
__EMPTY_LINE__


It is optional for the test data to provide relation instance.

Abstract Id: LLL.d0
Sentence Id: LLL.d0.s0
In vivo studies of the activity of four of the kinases, KinA, KinC, KinD (ykvD) and KinE (ykrQ), using abrB transcription as an indicator of Spo0A~P level, revealed that Entity0Xxx and Entity1Xxx were responsible for Entity2Xxx production during the exponential phase of growth in the absence of KinA and KinB.

In this mutant, expression of the Entity0Xxx gene, whose transcription depends on both Entity1Xxx and the phosphorylated Entity2Xxx protein, Spo0A~P, a major transcription factor during early stages of sporulation, was greatly reduced at 43 degrees C.
